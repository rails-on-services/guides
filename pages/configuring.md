[ros gems](https://github.com/rails-on-services/ros)

Core uses the [config gem](https://github.com/railsconfig/config) to expose Platform configuration

### [Platform Settings](#platform-settings)

In the core gem in config/settings.yml are the default values

{% highlight yaml %}
partition: ros
region: ''
service:
  name: iam
  policy_name: Iam

{% endhighlight %}

### Configuration in a Service

{% highlight ruby %}
Settings.service.name = ['whistler-api.perxtech.org']
{% endhighlight %}

### Override with Environment variables

List of ENVs to export for compose:
{% highlight bash %}
export RAILS_MASTER_KEY=
export PLATFORM__SERVICE__PARTITION_NAME=perx
export PLATFORM__JWT__ISS=perx
export PLATFORM__HOSTS = whistler-api.perxtech.org,another-host-name
{% endhighlight %}

### URN

`URN` is short for universal resource name

[x]confirm that iam, cognito, etc when running use the partition_name perx
