## Configuring Rails On Services

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

### URN

[x]confirm that iam, cognito, etc when running use the partition_name perx

List of ENVs to export for compose:
{% highlight bash %}
export RAILS_MASTER_KEY=
export PLATFORM__SERVICE__PARTITION_NAME=perx
export PLATFORM__JWT__ISS=perx
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
Settings.config.hosts = ['whistler-api.perxtech.org']
{% endhighlight %}
