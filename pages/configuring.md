## Configuring Rails On Services


[ros gems](https://github.com/rails-on-services/ros)

### URN

[x]confirm that iam, cognito, etc when running use the partition_name perx


### Service Settings

In the core gems in config/settings.yml are the defaults

{% highlight yaml %}
config:
  hosts: whistler-api.perxtech.org
{% endhighlight %}

### Override with Environment variables

Core uses the [config gem](https://github.com/railsconfig/config) to expose Platform configuration

List of ENVs to export for compose:
{% highlight bash %}
export RAILS_MASTER_KEY=
export PLATFORM__SERVICE__PARTITION_NAME=perx
export PLATFORM__JWT__ISS=perx
{% endhighlight %}

### Configuration in a Service

{% highlight ruby %}
Settings.config.hosts = ['whistler-api.perxtech.org']
{% endhighlight %}
